NOTE: THIS FILE IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!

#Encrypter.py
this filw searches for files (not folders) and generates a key using AES Algorithm and then starts encrypting it

#Decrypter.py
this python file asks the user to input a passcode to start the decryption 

#How it works
the first file generates a random encryption key and encrypts all the files using the algorithm and stores the key into a file "encryption_key.key"
after that this encryption key is used by the decryptet after gettiing the passcode to decrypt all the files to normal
